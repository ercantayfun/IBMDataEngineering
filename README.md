<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Program

You can check more details about the professional certificate on this link: <a href=https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-engineer><strong>IBM Data Engineering Professional Certificate</strong></a>

## **Program Details**

Throughout this Professional Certificate program, I will complete a series hands-on labs and projects using tools like Python, SQL, Relational Databases, NoSQL Databases, Apache Spark and developing skills as such building a data pipeline, managing a database and working with data in a data warehouse.

In the final course in this Professional Certificate, I will complete a Capstone Project applying everything that I have learned in a real-world inspired scenario that requires you design, deploy and manage an end-to-end data engineering platform consisting of various Relational, NoSQL & Big Data repositories as well as data pipelines to connect them.
