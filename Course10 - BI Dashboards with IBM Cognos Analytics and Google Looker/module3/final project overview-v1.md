# Final Project Overview

### Analysing car sales and profits for each dealer

You have been hired by *SwiftAuto Traders*, a chain of car dealerships, as a data scientist.  Your first task is to analyze car sales and profits for each dealer. You need to create some visualizations and present them as a dashboard/report to your regional manager for better understanding on car sales and profits for each dealer.
<hr>

You can either choose to use *IBM\'s Cognos Analytics* tool **(part a)** to create a dashboard 
**OR**
you can create visuals and submit a report using *Google\'s Looker Studio* tool **(part b)**.

### About the dataset

The dataset used in this lab comes from [here ](https://accelerator.ca.analytics.ibm.com/bi/?utm_source=skills_network&utm_content=in_lab_content_link&utm_id=Lab-IBMSkillsNetwork-DV0130EN-Coursera&perspective=authoring&pathRef=.public_folders%2FIBM%2BAccelerator%2BCatalog%2FContent%2FDAT00142&id=i22898C2A4DD748F79E0FC2BD017F4FE8&objRef=i22898C2A4DD748F79E0FC2BD017F4FE8&action=run&format=HTML&cmPropStr=%7B%22id%22%3A%22i22898C2A4DD748F79E0FC2BD017F4FE8%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22reportView%22%2C%22defaultName%22%3A%22DAT00142%22%2C%22permissions%22%3A%5B%22execute%22%2C%22read%22%2C%22traverse%22%5D%7D "here ") in the **IBM Accelerator Catalog**. The Terms of use for such are located at https://developer.ibm.com/terms/ibm-developer-terms-of-use/.

We are using a modified subset of that dataset for the lab, so to follow the lab instructions successfully, please use the dataset provided with the lab, rather than the dataset from the original source.


#### PART a: Create Visualizations using IBM\'s Cognos Analytics (OR Google\'s Looker Studio )

#### Objective:
The objective of this part of the Final Assignment is to analyze the historical trends in car sales for *SwiftAuto Traders*. The goal is to provide insights on car sales and profits for each dealer.

In this lab you will create a dashboard or report using either *IBM\'s Cognos Analytics* or *Google\'s Looker Studio*.
### Task Information
**Task 1:** Create a dashboard/report page titled as **Sales** to capture the following KPI metrics: 
    
   - Capture **Profit** (formatted to 1 decimal place in millions of US dollars)
   - Capture **Quantity sold**
   - Create a bar chart to capture **Quantity sold by model** 
   - Capture **Average quantity sold**

**Task 2:** Develop a column chart to display *Profit* by *Dealer ID* in the **Sales** dashboard/report page sorted in ascending order.

**Task 3:** Create another dashboard/report page titled as **Service** and capture the following KPI metrics as visualizations:
   - Create a column chart to capture the number of recalls per model of car 
   - Create a treemap to capture the customer sentiment by comparing positive, neutral, and negative reviews.
   - Create a line and column chart to capture the quantity of cars sold per month compared to the profit.
   - Create a heatmap (in Cognos) / Pivot table with heatmap (in Looker) to capture the number of recalls by model and affected system 

**Task 4:** Export the dashboard/report as a PDF to your *Downloads* folder.

<hr>

### Instructions for submission

<span style="color:red">You will be required to upload images showing your charts, dashboards or reports, for your peers to review and award points. For each part of the assignment, you will be directed to save the visuals locally with a specific name. We rcommend that you create a local folder and save all your images there for easy reference. </span>

<br>

For your assignment to be graded in a subsequent step in the course, you will be required to upload the PDFs of your Cognos Analytics dashboards or Looker Studio reports that you exported to your Downloads folder in Task 4.

###### NOTE: You will upload these exported PDFs to the Coursera platform as part of your submission. 
*(Important: If you cannot export your dashboards/reports as PDFs for any reason, then you must take screenshots of your dashboards/reports, and submit these for grading instead).*

<hr>

<ins>The **main grading criteria** will be:</ins>
- Have you used the correct visualizations?
